COMPANY: Resume AI
PRODUCT: Free AI-Powered Resume and Job Description Matching Platform

ABOUT THE CREATOR:
Resume AI was created by Eric Tuyishimire, a talented software developer based in Rwanda. Eric developed this innovative platform to revolutionize the hiring process by helping HR professionals efficiently rank and evaluate job applicants. His vision was to create a system that benefits both job seekers and employers by ensuring only qualified candidates with 50%+ match scores can submit applications, saving valuable time for HR teams.
